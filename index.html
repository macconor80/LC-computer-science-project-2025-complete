    <h1>My Premier League statistics website</h1>

{% block body %}

<p>Welcome to my webpage for my leaving Certificate project. For my project i explored different datasets from a range of different search engines and websites and from that research had the idea of sports statistics. I eventually came across a dataset containing Premier League fixtures from the current season. Each fixture had commonly collected data statisics from each match which i could compare on graphs and visualisations aswell as numerically calculating mean, median, mode and range data. This dataset i chose met all my basic requirements and was a topic i had an intrest in. In this website there is a "Home" page which you are in now, An "About" page with a summary of the Premier League and the page "Graphs and charts" contains 3 visualisations of differnt data from my dataset.</p>
